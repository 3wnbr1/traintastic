*Free and open source model railway control software*

## What is Traintastic?
Traintastic is a client/server software application to control a model railway. It is in an early stage of development, it contains very limited functionality.

## Goal?
Develop free and open source software which can control all aspects of a model railway.
- Cross platorm: Windows, Linux and macOS
- Multilingual software and user manual
- Easy to learn for new users
- Manual and automatic train operation
- Extensable by experienced users using scripting

## What can it currently do?
- Control locomotive decoders, via LocoNet, XpressNet or Z21.
- Act as WLANmaus controller, so the WLANmaus/Z21 app can be used with any command station.

### Supported command stations
- LocoNet:
  - Digikeijs DR5000
  - Uhlenbrock Intellibox
  - other LocoNet compatible command stations should work
- XpressNet:
  - Digikeijs DR5000 (untested)
  - Roco 10764
  - other XpressNet compatible command stations should work
- Z21:
  - Digikeijs DR5000
  - Roco/Fleischmann Z21 (untested)
  - other Z21 compatible command stations should work
