# Z21 app






## Known issues
1. Locomotive status updates slow.
   Reason: If the traintastic-server is restarted or the Z21 app controller is temparary deacribated, it looses the client registtation and they will no longer receive updates.
   Solution: Restart the Z21 app on your phone/tablet, then it will re-register and everything should work as expected again.
